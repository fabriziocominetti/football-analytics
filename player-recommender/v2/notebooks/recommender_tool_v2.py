This user-friendly interface allows you to explore player data and identify potential targets for scouting. It displays key metrics for the selected player and showcases similar players based on the applied filters. The ranking is determined through a model based on cosine similarity, and the data via FBRef refers to the 2021/2022, 2022/2023, and 2023/2024 seasons of the Top 5 leagues.")
