st.markdown("The Player Recommender Tool leverages data-driven insights to assist scouts, coaches, and analysts in making informed decisions during player recruitment and talent identification processes. This user-friendly interface allows you to explore player data and identify potential targets for scouting. It displays key metrics for the selected player and showcases similar players based on the applied filters. The ranking is determined through the application of a model based on cosine similarity, and the data refers to the 2023/2024 season of the Top 5 leagues, scaled based on 90-minute performances.")
